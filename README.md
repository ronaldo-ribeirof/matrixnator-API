# Matrixnator: A Simple Java Matrix Printing API

A lightweight and clean Java library for elegantly printing formatted matrices to the console. The goal of **Matrixnator** is to provide a reusable and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) API for visualizing two-dimensional data structures in a clear way, aiding in application development and debugging.

This project was created as part of my Java studies and personal growth as a developer.
